    "# Lab Deep Learning / Multi-Layer Perceptron for binary-classification / in pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "**Author: geoffroy.peeters@telecom-paris.fr**\n",
    "\n",
    "For any remark or suggestion, please feel free to contact me.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this lab is to develop a two hidden layers MLP to perform **binary classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a MLP with 2 hidden layer with $n_{h1}=20$ and $n_{h2}=10$ hidden units and ```relu``` activation functions.\n",
    "You will perform 1000 iterations (epochs) of SGD to find the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: for this lab, we do not separate the dataset into a train, validation and test part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "You should normalize the data to zero mean and unit standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to write NN model in pytorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will write three different implementations:\n",
    "- **Model A**: manually defining the parameters (W1,b1,W2,b2,W3,b3), writing the forward equations, writting the loss equation, calling the .backward() and manually updating the weights using W1.grad. You will write the loop to perform 1000 epochs.\n",
    "- **Model B**: using the Sequential class of pytorch\n",
    "- **Model C**: a custom torch.nn.Module class for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Model B and C, you will use the ready made loss and optimization from the nn and optim packages. You can use the same code to optimize the parameters of Model B and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are dealing with a binary classification problem, we will use a Binary Cross Entropy loss (use ```torch.nn.BCELoss``` for Model B and C).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters update/ Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "For updating the parameters, we will use as optimizer a simple SGD algorithm (use ```torch.optim.SGD``` for Model B and C) with a learning rate of 0.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't forget that an optimizer is applied to a set of parameters (```my_model.parameters()``` gives the parameters of the network for Model B and C).\n",
    "Once the gradients have been computed (after the backpropagation has been performed), you can perform one step of optimization (using ```optimizer.step()``` for Model B and C).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backward propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is automatically performed in pytorch using the ```autograd``` package. \n",
    "First, reset the gradients of all parameters (using ```optimizer.zero_grad()``` for Model B and C), then perform the backpropagation ```loss.backward()```. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Your task:\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to add the missing parts in the code (parts between ```# --- START CODE HERE``` and ```# --- END CODE HERE```)\n",
    "\n",
